# Cube Room

The Cube Room project is part of the project interactive [digital museum]([https://github.com/mboudr35/glgine](https://github.com/mboudr35/glgine/tree/music_show)) project that was created by a team of 5 and featured four sections:
- **Teleporting Train:** A room with a train that runs on train tracks. At the end of the track is a portal. The user can press E to board the train, which will make the camera follow the train as it moves along the track and through the portal.
- **Audio room:** An audio visualizer, that takes an audio file, and generates a visualization of the magnitude plot, using Fourier transforms.
- **Cube Room:** A room full of cubes, which come towards the user upon starting the game. The user must then press different keys properly to make the cubes disappear as they approach.
- **Colour Room:** A colour room, featuring a spotlight cast over certain objects. The spotlightâ€™s red, green, and blue components can be toggled independently. There are also three coloured, transparent lenses placed in front of everything that can also be toggled independently.

The **cube room** section is my contribution to the interactive digital museum project.

## Implementation
The **Cube Room** was inspired by the VR game *Beat Saber*, where cubes move toward the player, and the objective is to slice as many as possible. 

In developing this section of the project, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Modeled the Cube and Environment:** I created a 3D cube and set up the room environment where the game takes place.
2. **Cube Movement:** I programmed the cubes to move toward the player at a constant speed, adjusting the movement based on frame time to ensure smooth gameplay.
3. **User Interaction:** I added user input functionality, allowing cubes to disappear when the player presses a designated key, simulating the slicing action.
4. **Score System:** A scoring system was implemented, requiring the player to reach a specific score to win.
5. **Game Mechanics and Difficulty Scaling:** Additional features included dynamic difficulty adjustment based on the player's score and a game-over condition if a cube crosses a red line without being "sliced."

## Project Structure
The project contains several files and folders.

- **assets**: This folder contains all the assets used by the project, including:
   - **audio**: Contains sound effects and music.
   - **textures**: Contains textures files.
   - **libraries**: Third-party libraries used by the project (GLEW, GLFW, GLM, irrKlang).

- `CubeRoom.sln`: The solution file for Visual Studio, which groups the project files and allows the project to be opened and managed in the Visual Studio IDE.

- `CubeRoom.vcxproj`: The Visual Studio project file, containing settings for compiling, linking, and building the project.

- `CubeRoom.vcxproj.filters`: Filters used by Visual Studio to organize files within the IDE. This doesn't affect the actual folder structure on disk but helps organize files within the project in Visual Studio.

- `glew32.dll`: The GLEW dynamic library, which enables the project to handle OpenGL extensions.

- `ikpMP3.dll`: The MP3 plugin for irrKlang, necessary for playing MP3 files.

- `irrKlang.dll`: The core irrKlang dynamic library, responsible for sound playback in the project.

- `main.cpp`: The main source code file for the project, responsible for running the project.

You may ignore `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` as they are automatically generated by Git.
